GET YOUR NETFLIX ON! This app asks the user to type in their favorite netflix original shows and add it to an array of buttons on the page. Each button, when pressed, reveals a series of fun gifs from the show referenced by the button. These gifs are accessed from the GIPHY API. 

I seemed to have a difficult time getting the Gifs to pause and start. Eventually, with some guidance, I figured out that I was setting the value of the data-still and data-animate incorrectly. I proceeded to make this small change and thus fixed my problem.
